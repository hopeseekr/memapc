## MemAPC
### A PHP Key-Value store using APC

MemAPC is a PHP class which makes it easy to have a persistant, in-memory, key-value store using either
APC (http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php), Memcache (http://us.php.net/manual/en/class.memcache.php), or
temporary files (ideal for full (X)HTML caches).

To use, all you is a temporary system directory and some free disk space ;-) Of course, smaller caches work better with either APC
or memcache.
